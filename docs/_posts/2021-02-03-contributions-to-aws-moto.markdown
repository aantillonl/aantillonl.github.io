title:  "Contribution To AWS Moto"
---

I have been a long time user of moto, a testing library for AWS, and I wanted
to try my luck at digging deeper into it's implementation and if possible
make a contribution to this great project.

I was able to do two small contributions a few years ago. [Here are my
commits to the project.](https://github.com/getmoto/moto/commits/master/?author=aantillonl)
